*
* --------------------
* | TimerQueue class |
* --------------------
*        - A TimerQueue is an object used to execute delayed function calls. It can queue any number of function calls at the same time, while being based on a single timer. This offers much better performance than starting many separate timers.
*        - The class also provides methods to pause, resume, reset and destroy a TimerQueue - and even includes error handling.
*        - As such, you can create as many independent TimerQueues as you like, which you can individually use, pause, reset, etc.
*        - All methods can also be called on the class directly, which frees you from needing to create a TimerQueue object in the first place. You still need colon-notation!
*    TimerQueue.create() --> TimerQueue
*        - Creates a new TimerQueue with its own independent timer and function queue.
*    <TimerQueue>:callDelayed(number delay, function callback, ...) --> integer (callbackId)
*        - Calls the specified function (or callable table) after the specified delay (in seconds) with the specified arguments (...). Does not delay the following lines of codes.
*        - The returned integer can usually be discarded. Saving it to a local var allows you to TimerQueue:disableCallback(callbackId) or TimerQueue:enableCallback(callbackId) later. The callbackId is unique per callback and never reused.
*    <TimerQueue>:callPeriodically(number delay, function|nil stopCondition, function callback, ...)
*        - Periodically calls the specified function (or callable table) after the specified delay (in seconds) with the specified arguments (...). Stops, when the specified condition resolves to true.
*        - The stop-condition must be a function returning a boolean. It is checked after each callback execution and is passed the same arguments as the callback (...) (which you can still ignore).
*        - You can pass nil instead of a function to let the periodic execution repeat forever.
*        - Resetting the TimerQueue will stop all periodic executions, even if the reset happened within the periodic callback.
*        - Doesn't return a callbackId, so disabling a periodic callback is only possible via either meeting the stop-condition or resetting the queue.
*    <TimerQueue>:reset()
*        - Discards all queued function calls from the Timer Queue. Discarded function calls are not executed.
*        - You can continue to use <TimerQueue>:callDelayed after resetting it.
*    <TimerQueue>:pause()
*        - Pauses the TimerQueue at its current point in time, effectively freezing all delayed function calls that it currently holds, until the queue is resumed.
*        - Using <TimerQueue>:callDelayed on a paused queue will correctly add the new callback to the queue, but time will start ticking only after resuming the queue.
*    <TimerQueue>:isPaused() --> boolean
*        - Returns true, if the TimerQueue is paused, and false otherwise.
*    <TimerQueue>:resume()
*        - Resumes a TimerQueue that was previously paused. Has no effect on TimerQueues that are not paused.
*    <TimerQueue>:destroy()
*        - Destroys the Timer Queue. Remaining function calls are discarded and not being executed.
*    <TimerQueue>:tostring() --> string
*        - Represents a TimerQueue as a list of its tasks. For debugging purposes.
*    <TimerQueue>:disableCallback(callbackId)
*        - Disables the specified callback (as per Id returned by TimerQueue:callDelayed), making it not execute upon timeout.
*        - The disabled callback will stay in the queue until timeout, allowing you to TimerQueue:enableCallback it, if you changed your mind.
*        - Use this to cancel a future callback, when resetting the whole queue is not a suitable solution.
*        - CallbackId's are unique and never reused. Using one within TimerQueue:disableCallback after original timeout will not have any effect, but you don't need to worry about accidently disabling another callback.
*    <TimerQueue>:enableCallback(callbackId)
*        - Enables the specified callback (as per Id returned by TimerQueue:callDelayed) after you have previously disabled it, making it again execute upon timeout.
*        - Enabling a callback after its timeout has already passed while disabled will not have any effect.
*    <TimerQueue>:getTimeout(callbackId) --> number | nil
*        - Returns the original timeout of the specified callback (as per Id returned by TimerQueue:callDelayed).
*        - Returns nil, if the specified callbackId does not exist or if the callback has already been executed and thus removed from the queue.
*    <TimerQueue>:getElapsed(callbackId) --> number | nil
*        - Returns the number of seconds that have passed since the specified callback (as per Id returned by TimerQueue:callDelayed) was queued, not counting time passed while the TimerQueue was paused.
*        - Returns nil, if the specified callbackId does not exist or if the callback has already been executed and thus removed from the queue.
*    <TimerQueue>:getRemaining(callbackId) --> number | nil
*        - Returns the number of seconds that are left until the specified callback (as per Id returned by TimerQueue:callDelayed) will execute.
*        - Returns nil, if the specified callbackId does not exist or if the callback has already been executed and thus removed from the queue.
*    <TimerQueue>:hasExpired(callbackId) --> boolean
*        - Returns true, if the specified callback (as per Id returned by TimerQueue:callDelayed) has already expired (and thus removed from the queue) or never existed in the first place. Returns false otherwise.
*    <TimerQueue>.debugMode : boolean
*        - TimerQueues come with their own error handling in case you are not using DebugUtils (https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/debug-utils-ingame-console-etc.330758/).
*        - Set to true to let erroneous function calls through <TimerQueue>:callDelayed print error messages on screen (only takes effect, if Debug Utils is not present. Otherwise you get Debug Utils error handling, which is even better).
*        - Set to false to not trigger error messages after erroneous callbacks. Do this before map release.
*        - Default: false (because I assume you also use DebugUtils, which provides its own error handling).
*    local MAX_STACK_SIZE : integer
*        - TimerQueue uses table recycling to unburden the garbage collector.
*        - This constant defines the maximum number of tables that can wait for reusage at the same time. Tables freed while this limit is reached will be garbage collected as normal.
*        - Can be set to 0 to disable table recycling.
*        - Default: 128. Should be fine in most scenarios. Increase, if you expect to have a lot of callbacks in the queue.
* -------------------
* | Stopwatch class |
* -------------------
*        - Stopwatches count upwards, i.e. they measure the time passed since you've started them. Thus, they can't trigger any callbacks (use normal timers or TimerQueues for that).
*    Stopwatch.create(boolean startImmediately_yn) --> Stopwatch
*        - Creates a Stopwatch. Set boolean param to true to start it immediately.
*    <Stopwatch>:start()
*        - Starts or restarts a Stopwatch, i.e. resets the elapsed time of the Stopwatch to zero and starts counting upwards.
*    <Stopwatch>:getElapsed() --> number
*        - Returns the time in seconds that a Stopwatch is currently running, i.e. the elapsed time since start.
*    <Stopwatch>:pause()
*        - Pauses a Stopwatch, so it will retain its current elapsed time, until resumed.
*    <Stopwatch>:resume()
*        - Resumes a Stopwatch after having been paused.
*    <Stopwatch>:destroy()
*        - Destroys a Stopwatch. Maybe necessary to prevent memory leaks. Not sure, if lua garbage collection also collects warcraft objects...
